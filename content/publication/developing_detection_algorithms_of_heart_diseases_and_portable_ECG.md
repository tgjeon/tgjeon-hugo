abstract = "A heart disease usually leads to catastrophic results. Thus, detecting its symptom as early as possible is extremely important, which can increase the patientâ€™s survival probability. In this work we present i) detection strategy of atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemia using wavelet analysis and clustering, and ii) designed portable ECG which alleviates inconvenience of conventional immobile ECG used currently in many hospitals. From the raw data of ECG, we detect QRS-complex points using the wavelet method, and then extract several features such as the number of clusters of the return map (Poincare plot), slope of T wave, and so forth. Based on the extracted features, we train the classifier for detecting AF and ischemia using SVM. Experiment shows that our method gives better performance than others. And then we designed a portable ECG machine. Since it can be attached on the back or side of our body as a small device, we can maintain our daily life normally. Our detection algorithms are embedded into the machine, and the signals are collected and analyzed in almost real time. Our main contributions in this work are i) we provided a noble accurate algorithm to detect AF and Ischemia simultaneously, and ii) designed a practical portable ECG machine on which our algorithms are embedded."
