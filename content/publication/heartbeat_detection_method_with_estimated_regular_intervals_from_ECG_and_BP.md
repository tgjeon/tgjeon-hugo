abstract = "In this paper, we propose a robust heart beat detection method using signals representing cardiac activity directly in complex noisy environment. Proposed method extracts and matches characteristic points which provide essential information on estimating heart beats. The proposed method was applied to a data set of the CinC/Challenge 2014, and achieved a sensitivity of 99.65% and a positive predictivity of 99.64%."
