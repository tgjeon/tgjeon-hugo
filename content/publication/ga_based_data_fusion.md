abstract = "In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic detection of HABs using GA-DF on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). For this purpose, WSNs are designed to gather and process data from the environment in order to have a better understanding of the behavior of monitored HABs (Kim et al., 2007). In WSNs, data fusion can reduce the amount of data traffic, filter noisy measurements, and make predictions and inferences about monitored HABs. In general, data fusion (DF) methods are categorized into three levels: the raw data fusion level, the feature fusion level, and the decision fusion level (Eduardo et al., 2007). Here, we consider the raw DF method since the combined data can provide more information than individual inputs. Specifically, raw data fusion methods are classified into three categories: probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian reasoning and robust statistics), least squares (e.g., Kalman filtering, regularization, and set membership), and intelligent fusion (e.g., fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks). The proposed method is based on raw data fusion, which combines rough and different data sources so as to provide precise information with the minimized optimal probability of global detection errors."
