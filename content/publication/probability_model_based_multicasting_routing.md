abstract = "This paper presents a probability model based multicast routing algorithm guaranteeing Quality of Service (i.e., bandwidth and delay variant). The aim is to discover the minimal spanning tree (MST) from a source to multiple destinations using estimation of distribution algorithm. Each locus consists of a possible path from a source to each destination without repeating any node in the chromosomes. From each chromosome (i.e., path), we build a probability vector which represents the frequency of sub-path. The proposed algorithm reproduces the offspring from the probability vector. Experimental results show that the proposed probability model based algorithm outperforms other genetic algorithms"
