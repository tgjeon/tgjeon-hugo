abstract = "This study presents an obstacle map generation system using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. Automatic map construction is a military application of pattern recognition, geospatial information system (GIS) and image processing technologies. The immediate assessment of existence and the continuous collection of obstacle information play important roles on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). In this study, we analyze the methods used in map construction systems based on UAV imaging and extraction methods which generate geospatial features from aerial imaging. Class of geospatial feature is selected with an obstacle layer in vector product interim terrain data (VITD). We propose the framework for feature map generation with integration of digital terrain models and obstacle information extracted from aerial imaging."
