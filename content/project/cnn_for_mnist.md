**Sponsor**: Individual project

**Period**: May, 2016

**Task**: Classification of images of handwritten single digit.
 

**Description and contributions**

In this individual project, I show how TensorFlow can be used to implement the Convolutional Neural Networks. I introduce a short descriptions of the model, which serves both as a refresher but also as to anchor the notation and show how mathematical expressions are mapped onto TensorFlow graph.
Detail explanations are on the [project page](https://tgjeon.github.io/kaggle_MNIST/).

**Knowledge and Skills**

```python```, ```TensorFlow```, ```Convolutional Neural Networks```, ```Digit Recognition```
