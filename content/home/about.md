## Biography

As research scientist, my focus has been on identifying technologies that futher healthcare based on machine learning. I have spent the last 7 years for diagnosing cardiac diseases (Atrial Fibrillation, Myocardial Infaction, Ventricular Tachycardia, and Ventricular Fibrillation) and robust heartbeat detection from multimodal physiological signals (ECG, EEG, BP, EMG, and Respiration).
Also, I have designed and developed a prototype based on AM335x ARM Cortex-A8 and implemented device driver and numerical programming for real-time ECG processing and analysis. 

My current research focuses on stream processing and analytics based on deep learning for the biometric data.
