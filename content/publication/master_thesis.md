abstract = "The goal of this dissertation is to develop efficient applied algorithms to solve real problems like image registration and data fusion based on the design of bio-inspired computing (BIC). Recently, bio-inspired computing is a field of study that has been focused on, and it is a major part of natural computing that is a computation used existing process in nature. In general trends, several computing problems have been solved based on bio-inspired computing. This dissertation has made two significant contributions related to image analysis and data fusion. This dissertation presents a fast scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) using a niching particle swarm optimization based on similarity between Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) images. The aim of proposed method is to detect extrema in scale-space with converting exhaustive search problem into multiple solutions optimization problem. The niching particle swarm optimization model with modified initialization step finds effectively local extrema based on similarity of adjacent DoG images. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous SIFT algorithms in computational complexity and the number of detected features. A proposed genetic algorithm (GA) based data fusion methodology solves the data fusion problem which used for heterogeneous data in decision support systems on distributed sensor networks. For the realistic application, this methodology builds statistical models with heterogeneous data combined from logical sensed data and physical sensed data for detecting harmful algal blooms (HABs) which disrupt water ecosystems. Through the encoding of heterogeneous data, this method estimates the HABs states. The GA-based data fusion is able to provide theoretical models using the past meteorological records. Experimental evidence has been supplied to support the claims. Finally, this dissertation has suggested efficient design for image registration and data fusion based on bio-inspired computing. Our hope is that it will expand the area of applications related to bio-inspired computing."
