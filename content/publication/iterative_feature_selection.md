abstract = "The out-of-hospital-arrest (OHCA) is one of the major causes of cardiac diseases. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart malfunctions and stops beating unexpectedly. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular Fibrillation (VF) on electrocardiogram (ECG) are main symptoms of OHCA. VT and VF are life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias that could be catastrophic if no defibrillation shock is applied to the subject within a few minutes. This paper reviews recent published VF/VT detectors for shock advice algorithms. Four different groups of VF/VT detectors were evaluated: time domain, time-frequency domain, complexity domain, and spectral domain. The advantages and efficiency of different detectors are also compared and discussed. In this paper, we demonstrated optimal combination of features for VT and VF on overlapped sliding windows from various window sizes. The proposed shock advice algorithm with iterative feature selection method was tested on public MIT-BIH databases. Experimental results show that the proposed detection method improve the existing VT and VF classifiers in sensitivity and specificity."
