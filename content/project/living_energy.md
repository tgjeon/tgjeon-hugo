**Sponsor**: Gwangu Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) 

**Period**: 1/2016 - 12/2017

**Tasks**: 

- Develop perversive demand response (DR) based on Big Data analytics. 
- Optimize electricity load forecasting with energy patterns and factor diversification.
- Drive a long-term analysis and reporting based on load forecasting and electricity consumptions.
 

**Description and contributions**

In this project, I show how deep learning can be used to optimize electricity load forecasting. I introduce a short descriptions of the model, which serves both as a refresher but also as to anchor the notation and show how mathematical expressions are mapped onto TensorFlow graph.

**Knowledge and Skills**

```python```, ```TensorFlow```, ```Recurrent Neural Networks```, ```Load Forecasting```
